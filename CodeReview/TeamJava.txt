# Hw3 Code Review

+ Nice separation of concerns, 
+ I like that you have a method called ‘preFlightCheck’.
- Human readable error output would have been nice.
- Less cryptic names (“sm”, “stc”, etc.) would make code more legible (SemanticAnalyzer, 20).
- Unused boolean ‘ValidStart’; 39.
- Almost no comments.
- Wildcard import could be used to make the rest of the code in the class less verbose (SymbolManager, 4).
- Use of magic constants. Use Symbol.PrimitiveTypeSymbol.intType.name instead of “int”. (SymbolManager, 29-32).
- No case for non-existent class symbol (SymbolManager 67).
