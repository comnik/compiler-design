# Hw3 Code Review

+ Nice separation of concerns, 

+ I like that you have a method called ‘preFlightCheck’.

- Human readable error output would have been nice.

SemanticAnalyzer.java
---------------------

- Less cryptic names (“sm”, “stc”, etc.) would make code more legible; 20.
- Unused boolean ‘ValidStart’; 39.


ClassSymbolCreatorVisitor.java
------------------------------


SymbolManager.java
------------------

- Wildcard import could be used to make the rest of the code in the class less verbose; 4.
- Use of magic constants. Use Symbol.PrimitiveTypeSymbol.intType.name instead of “int”; 29-32.
- No case for non-existent class symbol; 67.
